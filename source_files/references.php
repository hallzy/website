            <h2>Arnold Fernandes</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Arnold Fernandes was my employer at
            ByteCom Computer Services in Surrey, BC. I worked for him at ByteCom
            during the summer of 2014, where I fixed and maintained our clients'
            computers.  A day's work would include talking to clients, finding
            solutions to their problems, and fixing them. Some of the work I did
            included malware and adware removal, setting up routers, setting up
            computers to be ready to sell, diagnosing and fixing hardware
            problems, and recovering data after hard drive failures.
