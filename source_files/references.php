            <h2>Malkinder Johal</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Malkinder Johal was my high school
            science and physics teacher. I assisted him in building an online
            teaching and assessment environment using various Google tools such
            as Google Drive, Google Docs and Google Script (which is just
            JavaScript, but has added methods and classes for interacting with
            Google Docs, Gmail and various other tools). I created Google
            Scripts in order to automate most of the assessment processes.

            <h2>Arnold Fernandes</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Arnold Fernandes was my employer at
            <a href="http://www.bytecom.ca/" target="_blank">ByteCom Computer
              Services</a>
            in Surrey, BC. I worked for him at ByteCom during the summer of
            2014, where I fixed and maintained our clients' computers.  A day's
            work would include talking to clients, finding solutions to their
            problems, and fixing them. Some of the work I did included malware
            and adware removal, setting up routers, setting up computers to be
            ready to sell, diagnosing and fixing hardware problems, and
            recovering data after hard drive failures.
